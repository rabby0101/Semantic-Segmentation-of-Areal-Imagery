In our rapidly modernizing world, many areas of our Earth's land cover are being urbanized or turned into adjacent land use types like farms to support our growing population. These types of activities have a large negative impact on the precarious ecological and climate states of our planet.

Specifically, many ancient forests and other carbon sinks are being turned into cities and other mono-culture land use types.

Developing a method to monitor and track these activities can be crucial in gathering evidence and enacting policies to safeguard our planet's most crucial natural land cover types. Satellite imagery and other remote sensing data are invaluable in the fight against climate change in areas such as fighting deforestation, land use carbon accounting, icecap monitoring, and many others.
